\chapter{Conclusions and Future Work}

The results of our study are promising as we believe they move us towards the goal of building a device that will continually monitor fetus pain.

We believe our work is capable of helping with the discussion in this field and provides unbiased evidence of pain presence, which may eventually lead to better conclusions on this research topic and for the development of a continuous monitoring system.
