\chapter{Experimental Results}

The metric used to evaluate the effectiveness of our models is the standard Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC), as adopted by \cite{abs-1807-01631}. Like \cite{CelonaM17}, we also used the leave-one-out method for cross validation and relevant hyper-parameters were found using a further internal comparison. The results reported are the average of the 15 runs, which are used to assess the overall performance of the models. Two variations of data augmentation intensity are also reported.

We have used the Grad-CAM \citep{SelvarajuCDVPB17} for interpretability, which is capable of creating a heatmap on the image with the fetures that were most relevant for the networks decision. An example can be seen on Figure \ref{fig:gradcam}.
