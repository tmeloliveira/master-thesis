I thank my mother Suely and my family for all the support they have given me and for always believing in my choices. I also thank my fiancee Maria, for being available in all the moments I needed the most. Without them, this journey would not be possible.

I thank my friends at Kunumi and the company itself for creating this rich environment, which made me a better professional and a better person. I also thank the Fetal Pain Study Group from USP, who made this research feasible. 

Finally, I thank my advisors Nivio and Adriano, for the trust and for the opportunity given when this was just a dream.
